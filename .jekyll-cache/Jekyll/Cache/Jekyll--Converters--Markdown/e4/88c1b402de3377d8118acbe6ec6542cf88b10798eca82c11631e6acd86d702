I"U<p>Course project where I had to write a Verilog program to visualize audio signals on a Basys 3 FPGA</p>

<p>Key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audio Frequency Detector with an accuracy of +- 1Hz between 400 Hz and 10 kHz</li>
  <li>FPGA rendition of the Flappy Bird game where birdâ€™s jump is controlled by amplitude of audio signal</li>
</ul>
